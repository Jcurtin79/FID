<h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

<p>
This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties.
My father recommends:
</p>

<p>
" Make this the night before so the flavors have time to blend. 
Just bring it up to room temprature before you serve it. 
In the winter try serving it warm. "
</P>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>
1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes <br>
2 large gaarlic cloves <br>
2/3 c. kalamata olives <br>
1 t. capers
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor.
Blend until as smooth as possible. 
</p>

<p>	
Add capers and olives.
Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, 
but still retain some texture.
